#The Student Helpdesk is a Java-based application designed to streamline the process of submitting and managing student complaints related to classroom or facility issues. Students can submit complaints through the system, which are automatically sent to the respective in-charge for resolution. The project uses Java for backend logic and database connectivity to store and track complaint records efficiently.
